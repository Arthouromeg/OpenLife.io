Welcome to a unique interactive experience where mathematics and nature collide. Dive into mesmerizing cellular automata and particle simulations:

- Conway’s Game of Life – Watch simple rules create complex, lifelike patterns in this iconic zero-player game.

- SmoothLife – Discover a continuous, flowing twist on cellular automata with organic shapes and fluid motion.

- Particle Life – Observe digital particles with attraction, repulsion, and chaos—simulating lifelike behavior in a physics-based environment.

Each simulation reveals how complexity can arise from simplicity. No two runs are the same—press start, and see life unfold before your eyes.



## Conway’s Game of Life
Created by mathematician John Conway in 1970, this is a cellular automaton — a grid of cells that live, die, or reproduce based on simple rules.
Each cell checks its eight neighbors and follows just four rules:

- A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives.

- A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive.

- All other cells die or stay dead.

Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life produces patterns that move, grow, replicate, and even compute — a zero-player game where complexity arises from order.

## SmoothLife
SmoothLife is a continuous version of the Game of Life.
Instead of square pixels that turn on or off, cells blend smoothly, and the simulation runs on floating-point values. This allows for more fluid, organic behaviors — resembling blobs, ripples, or even swimming creatures.

Developed by Stephan Rafler, SmoothLife demonstrates that lifelike behavior can emerge from continuous systems, not just discrete grids.

## Particle Life
Particle Life is a physics-based simulation where particles interact through attraction and repulsion.
Each particle belongs to a species with rules that determine how it behaves around others:

- Some attract others of the same type

- Some avoid others

- Some chase or flee from specific types

These interactions lead to self-organization, creating dynamic structures that resemble microbial colonies, predators, and swarms — all with no central control.
